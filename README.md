## Code

So at first we are going to ask the user to enter the email that is to be sliced.

```python
print("Please enter your Email Id:")
email = input().strip()
```

Here, as usual, we are making use of the **`input()`** function to get the input from the user in form of a string. We will store this input string in **`email`** variable.

Also we are making use of the **`strip()`** function. **`strip()`** function will remove any additional & unwanted spacing on both sides of the input string. So that we can make sure that we have only the email in the input and not any unwanted spaces.

```python
if email.find("@") != -1:
```

Here we are checking if the input string contains **`@`** or not. If it contains **`@`**, then it is considered as a valid email id and we move to the next step, which is slicing the email.

```python
username = email[:email.index("@")]
domain = email[email.index("@") + 1:]
```

Now, we print the **`username`** and **`domain`** to show the result.

```python
print("Your username is: ", username)
print("Your domain is: ", domain)
```

If the input string does not contain **`@`**, then it is considered as an invalid email id and we get out of the loop with a warning message.

```python
else:
     print("Please enter a valid Email Id.")
```

<!-- LOGIC -->

## Logic

Let's consider the input is **`avimax37@gmail.com`**, so when we write **`email[email.index("@"):]`**, our **`index()`** function will interpret it as **`email[:8]`** as our **`@`** is located at index **8**. Now **`email[:8]`** knows that **`@`** is located at index **8**, so now it will keep the part before index **8** and discard the rest. It will store the stripped value in **`username`**.

This exact same process is followed for **`domain`** also.
